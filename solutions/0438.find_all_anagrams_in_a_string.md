[438.Find All Anagrams in a String](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-all-anagrams-in-a-string/)

### 题目大意

给定两个字符串 `s` 和 `p`，找到 `s` 中所有 `p` 的`异位词`的子串，返回这些子串的起始索引，不考虑答案输出的顺序

`异位词`指由相同字母重排列形成的字符串（包括相同的字符串）

```js
Example 1:

Input: s = "cbaebabacd", p = "abc"
Output: [0,6]
Explanation:
The substring with start index = 0 is "cba", which is an anagram of "abc".
The substring with start index = 6 is "bac", which is an anagram of "abc".

Example 2:

Input: s = "abab", p = "ab"
Output: [0,1,2]
Explanation:
The substring with start index = 0 is "ab", which is an anagram of "ab".
The substring with start index = 1 is "ba", which is an anagram of "ab".
The substring with start index = 2 is "ab", which is an anagram of "ab".
```

说明:
- 1 <= s.length, p.length <= 3 * 10^4
- s and p consist of lowercase English letters.
